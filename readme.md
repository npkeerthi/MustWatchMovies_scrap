Actually You can find a txt file here named movies.txt 
Its not uploaded or copypasted .
even though u remove/delete that file and run still it gets back to You
Because it will be created everytime you run this program


And all about this project is to list out best movies in history
and add them in atxt file which is followed by some legal scraping
Everything done here was going through the html code of that page and just noting the title names of movie
